## Getting started

Instructions to run the website on your local machine [build instructions](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/intranet/tree/master/docker).

## Tech stack

Built using Wordpress (PHP), mariadb and NGINX. These are containerized via using Docker. The structure is setup based on [Bedrock](https://roots.io/bedrock/), which itself is based off of [12factor](https://12factor.net/) principles.

## Code style

This app follows the following coding standards and guidelines:
* [PHP Coding Standards Draft Proposal](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/php-coding-standards-draft-proposal/)
* [WordPress Coding Standards](https://github.com/WordPress-Coding-Standards/WordPress-Coding-Standards)

And if something cannot be formatted via the official Wordpress formatting standards to fall back to the [PSR-2: Coding Style Guide](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/) at a minimum.

* Frontend coding standards, see our WP theme page [Clarity](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/intranet/tree/master/wp-content/themes/clarity)
